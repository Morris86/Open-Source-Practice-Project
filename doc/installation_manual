1. Requirements for pre-installation: An operating system is required. Windows, MacOS or Linux. For Windows XP or 2003 are not supported. You can download a compatible version of XAMPP for these platforms here (https://sourceforge.net/projects/xampp/files/XAMPP%20Windows/1.8.2/). For MacOS, a native installer installs MariaDB, PHP, Perl, etc. directly onto your system. It supports intel (x64) or Apple M1 (arm64) CPUs.
